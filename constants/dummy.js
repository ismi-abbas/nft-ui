      'Park Shin Hye is a South Korean actress, singer, and model under S.A.L.T Entertainment. She was raised in Songpa District in Seoul, South Korea. She debuted in the entertainment industry by appearing in the music video "Flower" by singer Lee Seung Hwan, then undergoing formal training in singing, dancing, and acting. She gained recognition for starring in melodramas "Stairway to Heaven" (2003) and "Tree of Heaven" (2006).\n' +
      '\n' +
      "After graduating from Youngpa Girls' High School, Park attended Chung-Ang University while continuing her acting career.\n" +
      'In 2009, she gained more recognition after starring as a cross-dressing heroine in the romantic comedy "You\'re Beautiful," releasing songs "Lovely Day" and "Without Words" for its soundtrack. Despite the average ratings in South Korea, the series gained a cult following and earned high ratings in Japan.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Among Park\'s most successful films released in her 20s were the 2010 low-budget film "Cyrano Agency," a sleeper hit that attracted 2.7 million admissions nationwide, winning Park the Baeksang Arts Awards\' "Most Popular Actress" award in film, and "Miracle in Cell No. 7" which was released in December 2013 and became the fifth-highest grossing Korean film, sustaining over 75% attendance over a month after its release despite its modest budget.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On the small screen, Park starred alongside Lee Min Ho in the teen drama "The Heirs" which aired just before "Miracle in Cell No. 7" first hit the big screen. Its peak rating nationally was 28.6%, causing her popularity to surge, and internationally she became known as a Hallyu Wave star, over a billion views recorded on Chinese streaming site IQIYI alone. In 2014, another international hit was secured with "Pinocchio" earning over US $5.6 million in its first year alone. With this steady stream of commercial success, Forbes ranked her 33rd in their Power Celebrity list in 2015; she rose to 12th in 2017. She also received a service award for her achievements and was named an artist ambassador for Chung-Ang University upon graduating in 2016 with a degree in Theater\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In 2018, Park starred in tvN\'s fantasy suspense drama "Memories of the Alhambra" alongside Hyun Bin, playing a hostel owner who plays classical guitar. The series, distributed globally by Netflix and had a budget of 17 million USD, was a commercial success and, peaking in South Korea at 13.5%, became one of the highest-rated Korean dramas in cable television history.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Park's older brother Park Shin Won is a guitarist and composer. She began dating fellow actor Choi Tae Joon in 2017, and on January 22, 2022, the couple married. Their first son was born on May 31, 2022.\n" +
